Examples of previous coding projects from my current studies as an undergrad.

Both of the MP's are my projects from CS 128 in C++. The source (src) file has the functions I created.

The Python code is from my CEE 201 project. I was tasked with solving multiple optimization problems in whcih I had to map individual nodes to a real world map. I used networkx to solve large portions of these problems.
