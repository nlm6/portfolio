Examples of previous coding projects from my current studies as an undergrad.

Both of the MPs are two of my 4 projects from CS 128 in C++. These files include the grading and testing files that I began with. The source (src) file contains the functions I created in C++.

The Python code is from my CEE 201 project. I was tasked with solving various network optimization problems in which I had to map individual nodes to a real-world map. I used NetworkX to solve large portions of these problems.
